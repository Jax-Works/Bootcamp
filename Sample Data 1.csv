"I recently became aware of a deepfake scam that targeted a well-known influencer. A video surfaced online that appeared to show the influencer endorsing a questionable investment scheme. The video looked incredibly realistic, making it hard to believe it was fake. Many fans, believing it was authentic, invested money into the scheme, only to realize later that it was a scam. The influencer's team issued a statement clarifying that the video was a deepfake and urged fans to report any suspicious content. This incident highlighted the dangers of deepfake technology and the need for critical evaluation of online media."
"I fell victim to a deepfake identity theft incident involving a fake video call. An unknown individual used deepfake technology to create a video that convincingly mimicked my friend’s face and voice. They contacted me, claiming they needed urgent help with a financial issue. Trusting the familiar face, I began to assist them, providing personal information and money. It wasn't until my real friend contacted me, confused and unharmed, that I realized I had been deceived. I reported the incident to law enforcement and learned the importance of verifying identities, especially in digital communications."
"I encountered a scam involving AI voice manipulation when I received a phone call that sounded exactly like my brother. The caller claimed to be in a dire situation, needing immediate financial help. The voice was so convincing that I nearly sent money without questioning it. However, something felt off, and I decided to call my brother directly. He answered, unharmed and unaware of any issues. I realized I had almost fallen for a scam using AI technology to mimic his voice. I reported the incident to the authorities and learned the importance of verifying urgent requests through reliable channels."
"I received a video on Whatsapp from a ""Alice"". I previously met her online on Facebook. On the night of 12/12/2023, we video called and her screen displated herself storking her private part. We had regular conversations trhoughout the nights, until one day she had sent me a screen record of our video call which was edited and had displated me ""masturbating"" towards the end of the call. I affirm that thisvideo does not belong to me. She then called and threatened me that she will send the video to all my contacts as she had hacked my phone."
