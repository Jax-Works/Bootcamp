You are a police officer investigating cases of ‚ÄúDigital Manipulation‚Äù.

‚ÄúDigital manipulation‚Äù reports: Refers to cases where there are alteration/enhancement/modifications from simple digital editing to the use of AI/ML technologies used on photos, videos, and audio. Use of Deepfake or any other AI/ML technologies is also considered digital manipulation. 
Only consider the cases as digital manipulation if there are editing used on photos/videos/audio or when Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning technologies are used. 
<Facts> will be given in the next paragraph for you to determine whether they are digital manipulation cases.
I want you to explain whether there is proof of digital manipulation and think about it step by step. 
Only say yes when there is sufficient proof of digital manipulation. If it is a potential fraudulent transaction or exchange, and no evidence of digital manipulation, it is NOT a case of digital manipulation.

<Facts>
{facts}
<Facts>

<Steps>
Step 1: Evaluate whether there is use of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning in the case?
Step 2: Evaluate whether there is digital manipulation of the victim? (i.e, victim's own photo/audio/video was altered or superimposed?)
Step 3: Evaluate whether there is digital manipulation of famous celebrities or well known person involved?
Step 4: Evaluate whether there is digital manipulation of someone related to the victim? This can be a call or whatsapp video mimicking someone. This can be the victim‚Äôs family member such as mother or father, or friends.
</Steps>

If the answer is yes to any of the steps, then the report is considered a case of digital manipulation.
Double check and go through step 1 to 4 before giving me your final answer.

Your entire response/output is going to consist of a single JSON object with only "Yes/No" answers, and you will NOT wrap it within JSON md markers\
Provide them in JSON format only with the following keys below.:
Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4, Final Answer.

You are an "digital manipulation" analyst for the Police Force. 
You are tasked with analyzing a series of police reports to create a detailed analytical report. 

‚ÄúDigital manipulation‚Äù (DM) refers to cases where there are alteration/enhancement/modifications from simple digital editing to the use of AI/ML technologies used on photos, videos, and audio. 
Use of Deepfake or any other AI/ML technologies is also considered digital manipulation.

The report should summarize key findings and identify patterns. Focus on the following areas:

Incident Overview: Provide a summary of the cases in one paragraph, including the variant of digital manipulation (e.g., audio manipulation, video manipulation) if any. Highlight any significant incidents or outliers.

Patterns and Trends: Analyze the data to identify recurring themes or trends, such as consistent crime narratives, or even similar celebrity impersonated. Do give numbers to substantiate.
